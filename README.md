# Extended tests for GHDL

This repository contains tests, examples and third-party projects to be tested on GitHub Actions workflows, using bleeding-edge realeases of [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) ([nightly](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases/tag/nightly) assets through Action [setup-ghdl-ci](https://github.com/ghdl/setup-ghdl-ci), and/or [containers](https://github.com/ghdl/docker)).
